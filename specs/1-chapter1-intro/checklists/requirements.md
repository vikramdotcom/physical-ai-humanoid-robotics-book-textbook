# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 1 - Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: All items pass.

**Key Observations**:
- Spec defines 16 functional requirements covering content structure, quality, and extensibility
- 5 user stories with clear acceptance scenarios (2x P1, 2x P2, 1x P3)
- 10 measurable success criteria all technology-agnostic
- Edge cases cover reader backgrounds, navigation, component failures, and accessibility
- Assumptions and dependencies clearly documented

**Ready for**: `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
