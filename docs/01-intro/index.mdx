# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the first chapter of our journey into **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**. This chapter establishes the foundational concepts that will underpin everything we explore in this textbook.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Define Physical AI** and distinguish it from Digital AI using concrete examples
2. **Explain three key advantages** of the humanoid form factor for robotics applications
3. **Identify the major components** of the Physical AI technology stack (perception, planning, control, actuation)
4. **Navigate the textbook roadmap** to plan a personalized learning path based on your interests and background

## Chapter Overview

This introductory chapter is organized into four main sections:

### [What is Physical AI?](/01-intro/theory)
We begin by defining Physical AI—artificial intelligence systems that are embodied and interact with the physical world. You'll learn how Physical AI differs from Digital AI (like ChatGPT or recommendation systems) and understand the key components of the Physical AI stack.

### [Why Humanoids?](/01-intro/why-humanoids)
Next, we explore why humanoid robots represent a particularly compelling approach to Physical AI. We'll examine three key advantages of the humanoid form factor and take a tour of humanoid robot anatomy.

### [Technology Stack Overview](/01-intro/tech-stack)
We then survey the technology landscape you'll encounter throughout this textbook, including simulation tools (Isaac Lab, MuJoCo, Gazebo), hardware platforms, and the software stack (ROS2, PyTorch, policy learning).

### [Course Roadmap](/01-intro/roadmap)
Finally, we map out the entire textbook, showing how chapters build on each other and helping you identify the most relevant path for your learning goals.

## Prerequisites

This textbook assumes:
- **Basic programming familiarity** in any language (Python preferred but not required)
- **High school mathematics** including algebra and basic calculus concepts
- **No prior robotics experience** required—we build from fundamentals

If you need to brush up on prerequisites, we recommend:
- [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) for programming basics
- [3Blue1Brown Linear Algebra](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra) for visual math intuition

## Why This Matters

Physical AI is experiencing a renaissance. Recent advances in machine learning, simulation technology, and hardware have converged to make capable humanoid robots increasingly feasible. Companies like Figure, Tesla, Boston Dynamics, and Agility Robotics are racing to deploy humanoid robots in real-world settings.

Understanding Physical AI isn't just academic—it's preparation for a technological transformation that will reshape manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and daily life. Whether you're a computer science student, mechanical engineer, or simply curious about the future, this textbook will equip you with the knowledge to understand, contribute to, and shape this emerging field.

Let's begin our exploration.
